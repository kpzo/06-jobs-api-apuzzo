Hi there! another incomplete assignment. writing this here so I have something to submit in the form...

I want to really extend so much gratitude to Adil and Gina for cheering me on and letting me hold faith in myself that I could make it to the end of the course! Of course I didn't finish everything, but I did my absolute best and accomplished what I could. Without their encouragement I might've given up before building my final project!! Thanks to you both. I may sound like a broken record but let me say one more time how much I really learned in this process. Coding and self realizations alike. Really grateful for CTD. Ready now for Python!!

God Bless.
